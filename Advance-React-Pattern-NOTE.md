###### ADVANCED REACRT PATTERNS

##### 01. Context Module Functions

`The React Context Module Functions Pattern `is a design pattern used in React applications to provide global state management using the Context API.

##### 02. Compound Components


##### 04. Prop Collections and Getters

### Prop Collections

`Prop collections` are sets of related properties that are used to describe or define an object, component, or element in a programming language or framework. Prop collections are often used in frontend development frameworks like React or Vue.js, where they are used to pass data between components and define component behavior.

### Getters

A `prop getter`is a function that returns a prop value from a `prop collection`. `Prop getters` are commonly used in React and other frontend frameworks to pass data down to child components or to define the behavior of a component. Prop getters can also be used to create reusable components or to define a set of props that are commonly used in a project or application.
